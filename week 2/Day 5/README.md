What is the difference between inline and internal styles?
Inline styles defined within the HTML page element while internal styles are defined in the head section of the current webpage.
What will the following CSS styling do?
h1 {
     font-family: "Comic Sans MS";
     background-color: chartreuse;
}
It will change the font family to Comic Sans MS style and background color to chartreuse.
