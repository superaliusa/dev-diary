Reflect:

This class can be difficult at times, how does it compare to the things that you have done before?
This class is not very difficult but challenging. This class is not different as what I have done before.
We all have our own ideas and ways that we prefer to accomplish tasks, how do you think that people would fair if the class was run the way you prefer?
I personally feel the way in which class has been going is effective.

Review:

Add a mouseenter event handler to every anchor tag on the page that changes the text size.
I would add an Event listener to listen for when the mouse enters the anchors' domain on the page. I would also make a function to execute when the event listener is engaged. The function would change the text size of the anchors.
Add a user login page to your website so that people only see the pages you want them to see.
I would create a form in html and add the class id placeholder. for "name" and "password" then create a button.
Position an image in the center of the page.
I will use bootstrap for this.
